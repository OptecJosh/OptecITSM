/**
 * FreeitsmProvider — the "provider" for the self-hosted website chat channel.
 *
 * Unlike Twilio/Meta there is no third party to call: a web chat conversation lives
 * entirely inside FreeITSM. Inbound arrives through the public widget endpoints
 * (api/webchat/*), not the shared provider webhook, and "sending" a reply is simply
 * persisting the outbound message — the visitor's browser polls poll.php and picks it
 * up. So sendMessage does no network I/O; it just hands back a synthetic message id
 * for the emails.exchange_message_id column (kept unique for dedupe/threading parity
 * with the other channels).
 *
 * The class exists so the shared reply path (api/messaging/send_message.php, which
 * calls messagingProvider($channel)->sendMessage()) works for webchat with no special
 * casing — the one channel that has no external send still satisfies the contract.
