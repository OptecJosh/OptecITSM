/**
 * Knowledge — settings manifest.
 *
 * THE single declaration of this module's settings tabs, and therefore of its
 * capabilities. See includes/capabilities.php.
 *
 * Three of these four reach something that costs or leaks:
 *   - Email      — SMTP credentials for sharing articles out
 *   - AI         — the AI provider's API key
 *   - Embeddings — re-embedding the whole knowledge base spends real money
 * so all three are badged sensitive. The recycle bin (how long deleted articles are kept)
 * is the only ordinary one.
 *
 * Two endpoints here serve MORE THAN ONE tab, so neither can be authorised with a single
 * guard — both authorise per setting key, from the keys declared below:
 *   - api/knowledge/save_email_settings.php  → Email + Recycle bin
 *   - api/system/ai/save_settings.php        → shared by SEVEN modules' AI tabs
