/**
 * Workflow — settings manifest. See includes/capabilities.php.
 *
 * NOTE what is deliberately NOT here: authoring workflows. A workflow can send email, call
 * webhooks and change records right across the product, so the ability to write one is
 * governed by module access to Workflow — which is itself the strong permission, and the
 * one to be careful who you grant. These tabs are the module's own configuration.
 *
 * 'formats' are the webhook message shapes (Slack, Teams, Discord, …) — data, not code, so
 * that adding a new destination needs no release.
